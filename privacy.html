            <h3>The Key Point</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Your genetic data never leaves your browser.</strong> GenomeGist processes
              your genome file entirely on your device using JavaScript. We never upload, store,
              transmit, or have access to your raw genetic data.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

          <h4>1.1 Genetic Data (NOT Collected)</h4>
          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> collect your genetic data. When you upload a genome file
            to GenomeGist, the file is processed entirely within your web browser. The file
            contents are never sent to our servers. We have no ability to access, view, or
            store your genetic information.
          </p>

          <h4>1.2 Payment Information</h4>
          <p>
            When you purchase a Full Access token, payment is processed by our third-party
            payment processor, Paddle. We do not directly collect or store your payment card
            information. Paddle's privacy policy governs how they handle your payment data:
            <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              Paddle Privacy Policy
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>We receive from Paddle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your email address (for token delivery and order confirmation)</li>
            <li>Transaction ID and order details</li>
            <li>Country (for tax purposes)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>1.3 Access Tokens</h4>
          <p>
            When you purchase the Service, we generate an access token and store it in our
            database along with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The token itself (a random string)</li>
            <li>Number of sessions remaining</li>
            <li>Timestamp of last session activation</li>
            <li>Email address (for token recovery)</li>
            <li>Purchase date</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>1.4 Browser Storage</h4>
          <p>
            GenomeGist stores the following in your browser's localStorage:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your access token (if you've entered one)</li>
            <li>Your output format preference</li>
            <li>Your category selection preference</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to us. You can clear
            this data at any time through your browser settings or by clicking the "Clear"
            button in the app.
          </p>

          <h4>1.5 Analytics (Limited)</h4>
          <p>
            We may use minimal, privacy-respecting analytics to understand how the Service
            is used (e.g., page views, feature usage). We do not use analytics that track
            individual users across sites or collect personal information. We do not use
            Google Analytics or similar invasive tracking tools.
          </p>

          <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deliver your access token via email</li>
            <li>Validate tokens and manage session access</li>
            <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries</li>
            <li>Process refunds when requested</li>
            <li>Send important service updates (rarely)</li>
            <li>Improve the Service based on aggregate usage patterns</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information with
            third parties for marketing purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>

            <li>
              <strong>Email addresses:</strong> Retained as long as your token record exists.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment records:</strong> Retained as required by law for tax and
              accounting purposes (typically 7 years).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the
            information we store:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Token data is stored in encrypted databases</li>
            <li>All connections use HTTPS encryption</li>
            <li>Access to systems is restricted and logged</li>
            <li>We do not store sensitive genetic data (the most sensitive data never reaches us)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
