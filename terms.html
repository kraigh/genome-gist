          <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
          <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: January 25, 2025</p>

          <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
          <p>
            By accessing or using GenomeGist ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these
            Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
          <p>
            GenomeGist is a browser-based tool that extracts genetic variants (SNPs) from raw
            genome files exported from consumer DNA testing services. The Service processes
            your genetic data entirely within your web browser — your raw genetic data is never
            uploaded to our servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service offers both a free demonstration tier and a paid tier with access to a
            comprehensive variant database.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Not Medical Advice</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>THE SERVICE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.</strong>
            GenomeGist does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.
            The information provided by the Service should not be used as a substitute for
            professional medical advice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Genetic variants are only one factor in health outcomes. Many variants have uncertain
            significance, and scientific understanding evolves over time. Always consult a
            qualified healthcare provider or genetic counselor before making any health decisions
            based on genetic information.
          </p>

          <h3>4. User Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>You agree to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Service only for lawful purposes</li>
            <li>Only upload genome files that you have the legal right to access</li>
            <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the proprietary SNP database</li>
            <li>Not share or redistribute your access token with others</li>
            <li>Not use the Service to provide commercial genetic analysis services to third parties</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Paid Services and Tokens</h3>
          <p>
            Full Access tokens are purchased through our payment processor, Lemon Squeezy. Each token
            includes 3 analysis sessions. Each session provides 24 hours of unlimited access to
            the full SNP database, starting from the first use within that session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tokens do not expire, but individual sessions are time-limited to 24 hours from
            activation. Unused sessions remain available indefinitely.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Refund Policy</h3>
          <p>
            We offer refunds under the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Unused tokens:</strong> If you have not used any sessions on your token,
              you may request a full refund within 30 days of purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical issues:</strong> If the Service fails to function as described
              and we cannot resolve the issue, you may request a full refund regardless of usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Partial use:</strong> If you have used some but not all sessions, refunds
              are granted at our discretion on a case-by-case basis.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To request a refund, contact us at support@genomegist.com with your order number
            and reason for the request. Refunds are typically processed within 5-10 business days.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <p>
            The GenomeGist software, website, and curated SNP database are protected by copyright
            and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create
            derivative works based on the Service without our written permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            The output files generated by the Service are yours to use as you see fit, including
            uploading to AI assistants for analysis.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>,
            which describes how we handle your information. The key point: your raw genetic data
            is processed entirely in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Disclaimers</h3>
          <p>
            THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that the
            information provided is complete or accurate. Genetic annotations are derived from
            public databases and may not reflect the most current scientific understanding.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GENOMEGIST AND ITS OPERATORS SHALL NOT BE
            LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
            INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES,
            RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
          </p>
          <p>
            IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE
            IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
          </p>

          <h3>11. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless GenomeGist and its operators from any claims,
            damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Changes to Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes
            by posting the updated Terms on this page with a new "Last updated" date. Your
            continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
          </p>

          <h3>13. Termination</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time,
            with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use
            the Service ceases immediately.
          </p>

          <h3>14. Governing Law</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
            United States, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising
            from these Terms shall be resolved in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
